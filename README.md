# Blank Screen
My finest work. A blank page. Right-click to switch colors between black and white. PRO TIP: On video calls, open several browser windows, set screen to white, and move around to control shadow and lighting on your face.

This has the best code to usefulness ratio of any web app I have written. It's just plain HTML with embedded script and style. I have written this with a simple purpose: make my secondary screen black when not used. I wanted a simple way to do this without interacting with the monitor itself. I decided to add an all-white screen function to control the localized monitor lighting for webcam communications. No need for a separate lighting solution, as I already have giant monitors that can produce light.
